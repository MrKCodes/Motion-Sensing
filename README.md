# Motion-Sensing

### This has 3 modules:

* motion_detector.py : This will detect the motion in rectangular boxes as well as detects the Human faces.

* motion_detector2.py : This is simple motion detection script. It will show the moving objects inside the green rectangle.
                        For this to work, first frame should be as empty, meaning there should be no moving objects in the frame.
                        Its functionality is as it compares all the new objects entering and exiting the frame with the first frame.

* motion_sensor_with_records.py : This will record the IN TIME and OUT TIME of moving obejcts and save them in a CSV file.
